datepicker only shows when author is selected

Regional manager gets email of new requests
Authors gets emails on approvals by admin 

Regional can view requests (check the region and ensure manager is correct)

calendar doesnt get blocked until the admin approves the request

approval/decline of requests seemed to work as expected

-----------------------------------------------

Notes
Clickview form  - no author details
check author gets an email.

notes - permission - author should not see it
my requests page  - dont want to see pedign stuff

-----------------------------------------------
Fixes
Amended regional manager for default region - can you now access the requests and get emails
Click view form - fixed author details 
Can't replicate the author to superadmin error
